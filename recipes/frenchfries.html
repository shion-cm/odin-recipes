    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        French fries are batonnet deep-fried potatoes, possibly 
        originating from France. They are prepared by cutting 
        potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them.
        French fries are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner,
        or by themselves as a snack. They are often salted and 
        may be served with ketchup or other specialties.
