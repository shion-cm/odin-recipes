    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A hamburger is a food with several fillings. It usually
        consists of a patty of ground meat, placed inside a sliced
        bun, along with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickels,
        bacon, or chillis. Condiments such as ketchup or mustard are
        also often used. Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food
        restaurants, diners, or high-end restaurants.
