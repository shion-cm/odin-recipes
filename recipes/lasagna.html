    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta made of very wide, flat sheets.
       The term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked
       layers of lasanga alternating with fillers. The dish may be
       topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking.
       The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square
       portions.
